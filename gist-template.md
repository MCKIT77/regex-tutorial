# Tutorial: Demystifying the Email Matching Regex

As a web development student, understanding regular expressions (regex) is essential for effective text pattern matching. In this tutorial, we will delve into the intricacies of a specific regex that is used to validate email addresses. Regular expressions can appear cryptic at first, but by breaking down each component, we'll gain a clearer understanding of their power.

## Summary

In this tutorial, we will explore the following regex used for matching email addresses:

regex: /^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/

## Regex Components

### Anchors

Anchors are essential in regex for specifying the position of a match within the string. In our email regex, the ^ at the beginning and $ at the end indicate that the match should start at the beginning of the string and end at the end of the string. This ensures that we are matching the entire email address.

^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$
